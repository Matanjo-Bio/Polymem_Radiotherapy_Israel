            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1')">What are radiation burns and how do they differ from typical heat burns?</h3>
            <p id="faq1">Radiation burns are a common side effect of radiotherapy, a crucial part of cancer treatment. Unlike typical heat burns, which occur immediately upon contact with a hot object, radiation burns develop gradually. They originate deep within the body and manifest over time, starting with redness, progressing to blisters, and potentially leading to full-thickness skin damage. This delayed onset is a key difference, requiring a proactive treatment approach.</p>
            
            <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2')">Why is early intervention important in the treatment of radiation burns?</h3>
            <p id="faq2">Traditional treatment often begins after radiation therapy concludes, delaying the healing process. Early intervention is crucial because radiation burns develop gradually. Addressing the issue proactively can minimize the severity of the burn, reduce discomfort, and potentially accelerate healing compared to waiting until the full extent of the damage is apparent. PolyMem offers this early intervention approach, supporting continuous healing.</p>
            
            <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3')">What is PolyMem, and how does it address radiation burns?</h3>
            <p id="faq3">PolyMem is a wound dressing designed to treat various types of burns, including radiation-induced burns. Its key advantage lies in its ability to offer early intervention and continuous healing support. While the exact mechanisms of action aren't fully detailed in the source, the efficacy of PolyMem in the Israeli radiotherapy project suggests it provides a conducive environment for healing and reduces the severity of radiation burns.</p>
           <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq4')">What was the objective of the PolyMem Radiotherapy Project in Israel?</h3>
            <p id="faq4">The primary objective of the PolyMem Radiotherapy Project in Israel was to establish PolyMem as the standard treatment for radiation burns across all radiotherapy institutes in the country. This involved transitioning PolyMem from an optional product to an integral part of the therapeutic guidelines for managing radiation-induced skin damage.</p>
          <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq5')">What were the key steps taken to implement PolyMem as a standard treatment in Israel?</h3>
            <p id="faq5">The implementation strategy involved several key steps: identifying radiotherapy institutes, engaging with nursing teams through education and presentations on PolyMem's benefits, providing free samples for a pilot study, expanding the project after positive patient outcomes, developing customized post-radiation booklets with nursing staff, and securing agreement from institutes to include PolyMem in their official therapeutic guidelines.</p>
           <h3 onclick="toggleFAQ('faq6')">What were the results and impact of the PolyMem Radiotherapy Project in Israel?</h3>
            <p id="faq6">The project successfully introduced PolyMem as a standard treatment in leading Israeli institutes. The best practices were then shared nationwide, expanding implementation to all radiotherapy centres. The project also involved developing and funding brochures for multiple hospitals, providing clear usage guidelines for nursing teams. Ongoing support and funding ensure PolyMem remains the standard of care.</p>
